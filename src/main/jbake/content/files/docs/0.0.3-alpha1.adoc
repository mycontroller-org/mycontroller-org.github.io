== Introduction
MyController.org is a controller for the sensors world! Primarily it was developed to
 MySensors.org project. Later changed has design architecture to support other project also.
 Considered system resources in mind on development. As a result even we can run it on
Raspberry PI very first model.

You can control/monitor various sensors with this controller. As this
controller is a web application server you can access from anywhere if you have internet
connection. It has various features like, firmware control for nodes, alarms, timers., etc.

==== Timer types
image::timer-types.png[]

===== Simple
Simple timer operates with `Repeat interval` and `Repeat count`. Specify repeat interval in seconds. If you want to run this job count less specify `Repeact count` as `-1`

===== Normal
Normal is a very basic and classic timer. You can select "Normal" in the type drop down.

===== Cron
Cron is for advanced users. It is simple and easy.
After selected "Cron" if you put cursor on cron expression text box,
you will get pop-up with detailed tips. Here we are using quartz-scheduler cron tab,
visit http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger[Quartz-Scheduler] page for further detailed configuration

NOTE: Quartz-Scheduler cron supports from seconds.

===== Before Sunrise, After Sunrise, Before Sunset and After Sunset
If your task based on Sunrise and Sunset you have to go with this option.
Say you want to control your garden light based on your sun rise and sun set time. You can use this option.
You can specify time offset.

===== Frequency
3 types of frequencies supported by MyController.org

1. Daily â you can select all the 7 days or day(s) only you want to run
2. Weekly â Select a day in week
3. Monthly â Select a day in month

===== Time
Time format: `HH:mm:ss`

`HH` â hour in 24 hours format (0~23)

`mm` â minutes (0~59)

`ss` â seconds (0~59)

NOTE: For sunrise and sunset options "Time" will react differently.
If you select After Sunrise and After Sunset time will be added with "Time"  mentioned in task + "Sunrise" or "Sunset" time.
If you select "Before Sunrise or Before Sunset" "Time" mentioned in task will be subtracted from actual
"Sunrise or Sunset" time.

==== Payload
Set payload for that timer. When your timer triggers payload entered here will sent to selected resource. Payload supports special operations also, have look for detailed information of `Special operations`

===== Validity
You may feel you do not want to run this job all the time and want to run only on particular window period. In that case you can select validity.
You can select "Validity From" and "Validity To" or only either or nothing.
If you do not select any validity that job will be treating like never end.
If you select only "Validity From" job will run from that date and never end.
If you select only "Validity To" that job will start immediately and will end on the specified date.

=== Special operations
While defining payload you can assign following special operations,
All the special operation reads last received/sent value from target senor and doing this operation on top of that value and sends to target sensor.

==== Toggle
By assigning the value: `Toggle` You can select this operation. It is doing toggle operation.
This will be useful for 'BINARY' devices. For example if switch is `ON` it will be turned `OFF` vise versa.

==== Increment
By assigning the value: `++` You can select this operation. Adding 1 with the value.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 46 to target sensor.

==== Decrement
By assigning the value: `--` You can select this operation. Subtracting 1 with the value.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 44 to target sensor.

==== Addition
By assigning the value: `+3` You can select this operation. Here + meant for addition and 3 is the value should add.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 48 to target sensor.

==== Subtraction
By assigning the value: `-4` You can select this operation. Here - meant for addition and 3 is the value should add.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 48 to target sensor.

==== Multiplication
By assigning the value: `*2` You can select this operation. Here * meant for multiplication and 2 is the value should multiple.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 90 to target sensor.

==== Division
By assigning the value: `/3` You can select this operation. Here / meant for division and 3 is the value should divide by.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 15 to target sensor.

==== Modulus
By assigning the value: `%4` You can select this operation. Here % meant for modulus and 3 is the value used for modulus.
Example: last rx/tx value is 45, on resulting this operation will send 1 to target sensor.

==== Reboot
By assigning the value: `reboot` You can select this operation. On this operation target node will be rebooted.

==== Reload
By assigning the value: `reload` You can select this operation. On this operation target resource will be rebooted.

==== Enable
By assigning the value: `enable` You can select this operation. On this operation target resource will be enabled.

==== Disabled
By assigning the value: `disable` You can select this operation. On this operation target resource will be disabled.

==== ON
By assigning the value: `ON` You can select this operation. On this operation target resource will be ON.

==== OFF
By assigning the value: `OFF` You can select this operation. On this operation target resource will be OFF.


=== Forward Payload
image::forward-payload-menu.png[]

You can forward the data received by this sensor to another sensor directly without any condition.
This will be useful when you want to send your sensor data to multiple sensors.
No need to do any code change on sensor side. Simply add an entry in MyController.org and be
happy, MyController.org will take care.

NOTE: This operation supported across gateways too.

     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
