When you decide you want to start coding on MyController.og,
please visit the link:{link_doc_path}/developers_ide-configuration.html[ide-config] section and download
the respective settings file for your IDE. This settings file will help you applying the coding standards
that are checked on mvn install runs. To work on the code, it is best to fork the MyController
repository and then work there on your changes. Once you have made a change ready to go, go
to the GitHub repository and open a pull-request.
