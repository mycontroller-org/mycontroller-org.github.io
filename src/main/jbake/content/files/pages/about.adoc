       <p>
          MyController.org is a controller for the sensors world! Primarily it was developed to
          support <a href="http://www.mysensors.org/">MySensors.org</a> project.  Later changed it's architecture to support other projects also.
          Considered system resources in mind on development. Even we can run it on Raspberry PI very first model.
          <br>
          <b>What can you do with MyController.org?</b>
          <br>In simple words, You can  monitor and control your home from anywhere. It is home automation server. See the features provided by MyController.org.
